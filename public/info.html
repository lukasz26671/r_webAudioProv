Lyrics: 
Goodbye to my enemies, to my enemies 
They try to beat me but I won’t surrender 
Fear won’t be the death of me, da da death of me 
I won’t go quietly into the night 

My pain is a memory, a memory
Pouring over like the stormy weather 
Won’t get the best of me, best of me 
I won’t go quietly into the light  

Cause I believe, underneath, I won’t ever lose composure
No defeat, won’t retreat hold the line until it’s over 
All my scars, are tattoos they’re a work of art 
I believe, underneath I was born to be a soldier 
Reaching for my destiny 
Goodbye to my enemies 

I fight til the end of me, til the end of me 
Did you think that it would be that easy? 
This ain’t a tragedy, tra tra tragedy 
I’m not going six feet in the ground 

This ain’t a fever dream, it’s reality 
Cut me open and my hearts still beating 
Healed from my injuries, now I’m on my feet
I’m not going six feet in the ground</p>
